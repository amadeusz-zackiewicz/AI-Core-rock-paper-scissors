# What is this project?
This project is a simple rock paper scissors game that can be played by using hand gestures via camera.

# Milestone 1
I have created a simple model containing 4 classes; rock, paper, scissors and nothing. This model will be used to detect user gestures and play the game.
## Classes

# Milestone 2
I have configured my python environment using miniconda3, I have then used a code snippet to see if I can run it and installed all prerequisites as required. Please see requirements.txt for full list of dependencies.
